## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Linear regression was used to see what car attributes are the best predictors of mpg with the results as follows:

From this analysis we can say:
* Car length and ground clearance both have p values indicating that they are significant predictors of vehicle mpg
* The slope of the lines are non-zero
* This model has about a 71% chance of correctly predicting mpg for future car makes.
